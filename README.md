## Architecture

### Technology Stack

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.x or higher
- Dart SDK
- For Android: Android Studio and SDK
- For macOS/iOS: Xcode
- (Optional) Syncthing for cross-device sync

### Quick Start (Using Makefile)

```bash
# Complete setup from scratch
make setup

# Run for fast development
make run-web        # Chrome (fastest hot reload)
make run-macos      # macOS native
make run-android    # Android emulator

# Other commands
make help           # Show all available commands
make test           # Run tests
make build-web      # Build for web
```

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd open_score
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate database code**
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **(Web only) Compile drift worker**
   ```bash
   dart compile js -O4 web/drift_worker.dart -o web/drift_worker.js
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # For Android
   flutter run -d android

   # For macOS
   flutter run -d macos

   # For iOS
   flutter run -d ios

   # For Web (development iteration only)
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | ✅ Full support | Primary platform |
| iOS | ✅ Full support | Native file system |
| Android | ✅ Full support | Native file system |
| Web | ⚠️ Limited | For development iteration only |

**Web limitations:**
- PDFs stored as bytes in IndexedDB (not file system)
- No Syncthing integration (no file watching)
- No directory scanning
- Use for fast UI/layout development with hot reload

## Syncthing Setup for Multi-Device Sync

### 1. Install Syncthing
- **macOS**: `brew install syncthing`
- **Android**: Install from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)
- **iOS**: Use [Möbius Sync](https://apps.apple.com/app/mobius-sync/id1539203216)

### 2. Locate Open Score Data Directory

The app stores data in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.openscore.openScore/open_score/`
- **Android**: `/data/data/com.openscore.open_score/app_flutter/open_score/`
- **iOS**: App's Documents directory

You can find the exact path in the app by checking debug logs or settings.

### 3. Configure Syncthing

1. Create a new folder in Syncthing pointing to the Open Score directory
2. Share this folder with your other devices
3. The folder contains:
   - `pdfs/` - Your PDF files
   - `open_score_db.sqlite` - The database
   - Database WAL files (`.sqlite-wal`, `.sqlite-shm`)

### 4. Important Syncthing Settings

- **File versioning**: Recommended to enable "Simple File Versioning" to prevent data loss
- **Ignore patterns**: The app automatically filters Syncthing temp files
- **Watch for changes**: Enable for instant sync

### 5. How It Works

1. Open Score monitors the PDF directory and database file
2. When Syncthing syncs changes, the file watcher detects them
3. The app automatically:
   - Reloads the database
   - Refreshes the library
   - Updates annotations
4. Changes made on one device appear on others within seconds

### Notes
- Close the app before large sync operations for best results
- The app pauses file watching when in background to save resources
- Database uses WAL mode to minimize lock conflicts during sync

## Usage Guide

### Importing PDFs
1. Tap the **+** button in the Library screen
2. Select a PDF file from your device
3. The file is copied to Open Score's managed directory
4. Alternatively, add PDFs directly via Syncthing

### Viewing PDFs
1. Tap any PDF in the library to open it
2. Pinch to zoom in/out
3. Tap the screen to show/hide controls
4. Use the **Display Settings** button (tune icon) to adjust brightness and contrast
5. Navigate pages with left/right buttons or swipe gestures

### Adding Annotations
1. Open a PDF
2. Tap the **pen icon** to enter annotation mode
3. Select a tool (pen, highlighter, or eraser)
4. Choose a color
5. Adjust thickness by tapping the line weight icon
6. Draw on the PDF
7. Tap the **layers icon** to manage layers

### Creating Set Lists
1. Go to the **Set Lists** tab
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Add documents from your library
5. Reorder by dragging
6. Tap the **play icon** to start performance mode

### Performance Mode
- Swipe or use arrows to navigate between pieces
- Tap to show/hide controls
- Tap the list icon to jump to a specific document
- Full-screen view optimized for reading while performing

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **CI** | Push, PR to `main`/`develop` | Run tests, analysis, and build web |
| **Build All Platforms** | Manual, version tags | Build Android, macOS, iOS, Web |
| **Release** | Version tags (`v*.*.*`) | Create GitHub releases with artifacts |
| **Deploy to Pages** | Push to `main` | Deploy web version to GitHub Pages |

### Running CI Locally

```bash
# Run the same checks as CI
make format     # Check formatting
make analyze    # Run static analysis
make test       # Run all tests
make build-web  # Build web version
```

### Creating a Release

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes
2. Commit and push changes
3. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash

   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build for all platforms
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload all build artifacts
